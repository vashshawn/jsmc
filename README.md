jsmc (whiskers75/Miney edition)
====

Overview
--------

jsmc is designed to be a very flexible, very hackable, moderately performant
Minecraft server. It's written in JavaScript and runs well under node.js. Expanded by whiskers75

DEMO
----

There's usually a copy of recent (vanilla) code running on `fknsrs.biz:25565` if you just
want to kick the tires without installing anything.

whiskers75/jsmc code will be hosted as soon as someone can find a host.

Features
--------

* Plugins all the way down!
* Cross platform (runs anywhere node.js does)!
* Easy to expand
* Protection system (whiskers75)
* Player data saves (whiskers75)
* 

Compatibility
-------------

The latest supported version of Minecraft client is 1.5.2! (Thanks to superjoe30 and SomeoneWeird for the patches!)
Please be aware that this project is very far from being a full Minecraft server - there are lots of holes!

Installation
------------

Vanilla jsmc code is available via [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

> $ npm install jsmc

whiskers75/miney devel code is available by git:

> $ git clone git://github.com/whiskers75/jsmc.git  
> $ cd jsmc  
> $ npm install  
(and possibly)
