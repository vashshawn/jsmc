Haha, who would write a Minecraft server in JavaScript anyway?

Overview
--------

jsmc is designed to be a very flexible, very hackable, moderately performant
Minecraft server. It's written in JavaScript and runs well under node.js.

There's usually a copy of recent (vanilla) code running on `fknsrs.biz:25565` if you just
want to kick the tires without installing anything.

Features
--------

* Plugins all the way down!
* Cross platform (runs anywhere node.js does)!

Compatibility
-------------

The latest supported version of Minecraft client is 1.4.6.

Installation
------------

Available via [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

> $ npm install jsmc

Or via git:

> $ git clone git://github.com/deoxxa/jsmc.git  
> $ cd jsmc  
> $ npm install  

Usage
-----

```
$ ./server.example.js config.default.json
```
(not that you'll be doing that)
