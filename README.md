jsmc (whiskers75/Miney edition)
====

Haha, who would write a Minecraft server in JavaScript anyway?
(whiskers75: Well, I would...)

Overview
--------

jsmc is designed to be a very flexible, very hackable, moderately performant
Minecraft server. It's written in JavaScript and runs well under node.js.

DEMO
----

There's usually a copy of recent (vanilla) code running on `fknsrs.biz:25565` if you just
want to kick the tires without installing anything.

whiskers75/Miney code will be hosted as soon as someone can find a host.

Features
--------

* Plugins all the way down!
* Cross platform (runs anywhere node.js does)!

Compatibility
-------------

The latest supported version of Minecraft client is <s>1.4.6</s> <s>1.4.7</s> 1.5.1! (Thanks to superjoe30 and SomeoneWeird for the patches!)

Installation
------------

Vanilla jsmc code is available via [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

> $ npm install jsmc

whiskers75/miney devel code is available by git:

> $ git clone git://github.com/whiskers75/jsmc.git  
> $ cd jsmc  
> $ npm install  
(and possibly)
> $ npm install winston (if it's needed)
